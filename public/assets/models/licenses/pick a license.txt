Are you sure? I thought it was that they all apply? So that people could combine licenses?

@Kemono, Yeah, I'm sure. Multilicensing (Wikipedia) The article references software but applies in the same way to art.

Multi-licensing is the practice of distributing software under two or more different sets of terms and conditions. This may mean multiple different software licenses or sets of licenses. [...]

When software is multi-licensed, recipients can choose the terms under which they want to use or distribute the software. [...] The two usual motivations for multi-licensing are license compatibility and market segregation based business models.
It's almost never useful to combine licenses. Often, this would create an incompatibility and make the piece of art legally impossible to use anywhere.
